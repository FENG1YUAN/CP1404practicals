# CP1404 Practicals

## Introduction

Hello! My name is FENG YUAN. This repository contains all my practical works and exercises for the CP1404 course. 
Throughout this course, I've been refining my skills in Python and have learned several valuable lessons, especially 
about writing clean and efficient code.

### About Me

## Main Lessons on Clean Code

1. **Readability**: Always prioritize making your code easily understandable. This not only benefits others who 
might read your code, but also your future self.
2. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: By maintaining consistent naming conventions, the code becomes more predictable 
and easier to navigate.
3. **Pseudo-code**: Pseudo-code should be easy to read, easy to write, easy to understand, excluding UI details.
