# Reflection on Practical Tasks - Prac 10

## Estimation Accuracy

During the course of practical tasks, I was required to estimate the time and effort it would take to complete each 
task. Initially, my estimations were off as I either underestimated or overestimated the complexity of the tasks. 
However, as I delved deeper into the subject, my accuracy in estimations improved. I learned how to better gauge the
time it would take to understand, implement, and debug code. This iterative process honed my skills not only in coding
but also in project management and time allocation.

## Code Reviews

Engaging in code review processes has been enlightening. Being reviewed taught me the importance of writing clean, 
readable code and adhering to coding standards. It opened my eyes to common mistakes and areas of improvement in my 
code. On the other hand, reviewing others' code was a learning experience too. It helped in recognizing good coding 
practices and also in learning new approaches to solving problems. Here are two Pull Requests where I conducted code
reviews:

## Practical Tasks Reflection

The practical tasks were well-designed to encompass a wide range of topics and hands-on experience on loops, data 
structures, inheritance, files handling, error handling, and much more. However, if I were in charge of the subject, 
I would introduce more real-world projects that encapsulate the integration of these individual concepts. It would be
beneficial to see how these concepts mesh together in a larger, more complex system. Moreover, I would incorporate more
collaborative tasks to foster teamwork and collective problem-solving, as these are essential skills in the software 
development world.

## Conclusion

The journey through this subject has been an enriching one, full of learning and growth. It has not only improved my 
technical skills but also my ability to work in a team, review code constructively, and manage my time effectively. 
The feedback loop from the practical tasks and code reviews has been invaluable in reflecting on my progress and 
identifying areas for further improvement.
